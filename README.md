## Description

FitLit will enable you to take control of your fitness by having the ability to view fitness reports on hydration, sleep and activity levels. This application also includes the user's information and compares their results with the FitLit community.   

On reload, a user is randomly generated and their given fitness portfolio will be attached (under the profile tab). On the homepage, icons from left to right represent their activity, hydration, and sleep routine. Each category has its own theme, mouseover categories, and has the option to view more data. When clicked, the cards flip to the backside, and additional user's stats, charts and FitLit community data is shown.

FitLit was designed to be used with various devices and demonstrates:
* Adherence to Test Driven Development
* Considerations for accessibility
* Usage of third party libraries (Chart.js) to display data
